# sdsw-riak-bash

These are my notes, scratches, and exercises while going through the Riak section of [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks).

Instead of just calls through `curl`, I wanted to try out Riak with a client. This version uses [riak-js](http://riakjs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

## Setup

The book builds Riak from source, whereas I decided to try it with homebrew. The examples in the book use port 8091, but the homebrew installation uses 8098. Also, the book assumes three nodes of Riak, but I just used the default setup with homebrew.

Set ulimit to at least 1024

```bash
ulimit -n 1024
```

Install riak:

```bash
brew install riak
```

To start the riak server:

```bash
riak start
```

Location of the Riak app.config:

```bash
"`brew --prefix riak`/libexec/etc/app.config"
```

Make sure these settings are as follows in the app.config:

```erlang
[
  {js_source_dir, "/Users/yourname/path/to/repo"},
  {riak_search, [
                 {enabled, true}
                ]},
  {riak_kv, [
    {storage_backend, riak_kv_eleveldb_backend}
  ]}
]
```

Then restart the riak server:

```bash
riak restart
```

Install the necessary packages from npm

```bash
npm install
```
